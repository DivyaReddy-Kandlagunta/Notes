What is Billing in Singleview?
Billing in Singleview refers to the process of calculating and generating invoices for customers based on their usage, subscriptions, and any applicable charges or discounts. The billing process typically involves:

  Usage Collection: Gathering data on customer activities, such as calls, data usage, or other services.
  Aggregation: Summing up the usage and charges for a specific billing cycle.
  Invoice Generation: Creating detailed bills, including itemized charges, taxes, and discounts.
  Delivery: Sending the invoice to the customer (electronically or physically).
  Billing ensures customers are charged correctly and transparently for the services they use.

What is Rating in Singleview?
  Rating in Singleview is the process of assigning monetary values to a customer's usage events (like calls, data, or messages). It involves:

  Event Processing: Each customer activity (e.g., a phone call) is treated as an event.
  Rate Application: Applying predefined pricing rules or rate plans to determine the cost of each event.
  Example: $0.10 per minute for local calls or $1.00 per GB of data.
  Output: Calculating the total charge for the usage event.
  Rating is a crucial step that happens before billing, as it converts raw usage data into billable amounts.

Difference Between Billing and Rating:
  Rating: Focuses on calculating the cost of individual usage events.
  Billing: Aggregates all charges (including rated usage, subscriptions, and other fees) and generates a customer invoice.

Example in Telecom:
  A customer makes a 10-minute call.
Rating: Singleview applies the rate of $0.10/min to calculate the cost of the call: $1.00.
  At the end of the month:
Billing: Singleview totals all charges, adds taxes, applies discounts, and generates a detailed bill for the customer.
This integration of billing and rating in Singleview makes it ideal for handling complex pricing models and high transaction volumes efficiently.
