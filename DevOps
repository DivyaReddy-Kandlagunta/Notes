DevOps: It combines Software Development(Dev) with Information Technology Operations to improve the efficiency and quality of software development, delivery and deployment. It improves teamwork between the development and operations teams so that they may collaborate easily across the whole software development life cycle.
Continouus Integration: It is a process of integrating code into mainline base code. It is specially designed to regularly integrate code changes into a shared code repository. It's main aim is to provide rapid feedback so that if there is any defect in the code base, it can be resolved as soon as possible.
Continuous Deployment: It is a process that involves testing, staging and deploying code that happens after code is integrated. It is specially designed to ensure that code can be rapidly and safely deployed to production by delivering every change to production. Its main aim is to have a code base that is always ready for deployment to the production environment. 
Centralized Vs Distributed:
    A centralized system is a computing architecture where all processing, decision-making, and data storage are handled by a single, central entity (such as a server). All users and devices rely on this central point for access and functionality.
    A distributed system is a network of independent computers that work together to achieve a common goal. Each system has its own processing power and may share data or resources, collaborating as a single cohesive system.
